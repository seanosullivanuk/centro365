Make your administration of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure just that little bit easier.

Centro 365 provides quick and convenient access to many of the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure Admin Centres. Whether you administrate just one area, or you're a Global Administrator, this handy cascading menu keeps everything within close reach.

There's also support for dark mode, which switches in and out automatically, matching your operating system. What more can I say? It's a simple and straightforward web browser extension, whipped up over the course of a weekend whilst my wife was watching the racing. 🐴
